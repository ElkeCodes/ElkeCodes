# Hi there, I'm Elke, a fullstack developer! 👋

I'm currently building modern web applications with Vue.js and Python, backed by PostgreSQL for reliable data management.
My background includes developing multiple React & Angular projects and architecting Node.js and C# backends, giving me a versatile perspective on fullstack development.
I'm based in Belgium and currently working fully remote.

When I'm not coding, you can find me go on a run or do a HIIT workout to stay active.
I’m also raising an amazing son with my fantastic wife, which is the most rewarding adventure of all.
Big fan of board games and Dungeons & Dragons for some creative escapism, and I always enjoy tinkering with newer tech to see what’s possible.

I share my thoughts, projects, and occasional ramblings over at [elkecodes.dev](https://elkecodes.dev).
